Problem Statement:

A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.
To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft PowerBI and SQL as the BI tools for this project

MySQL Classic model Schema:
1-The MySQL sample database schema consists of the following 8 tables:
2-Customers: stores customerâ€™s data.
3-Products: stores a list of scale model cars.
4-ProductLines: stores a list of product line categories.
5-Orders: stores sales orders placed by customers.
6-OrderDetails: stores sales order line items for each sales order.
7-Payments: stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.
8-Employees: stores all employee information as well as the organization structure such as who reports to whom.
9-Offices: stores sales office data

Steps Performed to complete the project....
Use the data source provided: Used the Classic Model database provided as a data source.

Extract and clean the data: Next I have extracted the data from the identified sources and cleaned it to make it ready for analysis. This involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
